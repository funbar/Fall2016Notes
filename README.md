# Fall2016Notes


### IceScrum
##### Sprint Plan
- View/Create Tasks and move them around accordingly

##### Release Plan
- Displays all springs and statuses of where they currently are

##### Timeline
- Shows a more undefined/vague overview of the whole project. This includes the sprint numbers and the project.

##### Product Backlog
- Contains stories which have been accepted by the product owner.

##### Sandbox
- Stories go into the sandbox 

##### Dashboard
- Displays a graph visual, kind of like Github which allows others to monitor how the sprints are being handled. Also shows an overview of the project description, release vision, retrospective, activity log, etc.

### Final Exam

- A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) divides work into manageable pieces.
- Gantt Charts illustrate project schedules by using horizontal lines.
- Entity-Centered models need to have all issues in one category to be closed before any in the next category can be opened. Kind of like traveling together to the next destination with everyone's approval and without leaving anyone behind.
- No process is ideal or pure; in reality, real processes are a hybrid mix which takes different ideas from the models.
- Methodology is a collection of methods and tools for developing and managing a software system. 
- Proxy Client has knowledge but no authority
- Pseudo client has authority but no knowledge
- Royce's Methodology (based on Unified Process) uses visual modeling languages such as UML.
- Principles of Extreme Programming is basically meant to seize the day: Quality work the first time without going back and fixing things later, design focuses on current requirements without concerning the future, and also testing confronting issues early on. 
- A Document Rationale is used people sometimes new people might join the project. They need to be told how the system is built and WHY it is built like that. Also, they need to know what ideas have been considered and rejected, too.
- Steps for capturing a rationale: 
  -> identify the issues 
  -> proposals address the issues 
  -> criterion is used to evaluate proposals 
  -> arguments advocate for or against different proposals based on criteria 
  -> resolutions document final decisions and resolve issues 
  -> Action items document what is to be done to implement resolutions

### Questions for Midterm #1


- Q:What is the key feature that distinguishes agile development methods from more traditional classical Software Engineering approaches?
- A: Lecture #1

- Q:What is shown in a UML use-case diagram?
- A:
- Q&A: -|> is arrow for inheritance

- Q:What type of diagram is nearly equivalent to a sequence diagram?
- A:Communication diagram

- Q:What is the first step in developing tasks for a new scenario in iceScrum
- A:


### Topics for Midterm #1

- The Classic Waterfall Model
- The V model
- Activity Diagram 
### Iterative Approaches
- Boehm's Spiral Model
- Unified Process

### Agile Development
- Embrace change, rather than fear it
- Development in small chunks without planning the whole project out. Do it as you go.
- Incremental functionality delivered as the project proceeds
- Rapid development methods
- More suitable for small teams working on shorter-term projects

- Rugby method is moving forward in a series of sprints.

### Use Case Diagram
- AKA Scenario diagrams

- Scenarios are informal stories written in a narrative fashion. They help convey a general understanding
- Use Cases are more formal

### Sequence Diagrams 

- document the steps taken during a single use case

### Communication Diagrams

- AKA collaboration diagrams
- Same info as a sequence diagram

# Older stuff is below this line ---------------------------

### Requirements
- Specific, detailed, unambiguous specifications of the features
- Often used as a contract between others
- Functional Requirements specify features the SW must perform
- Non-Function Requirements specify other properties the system must have
- WHAT versus HOW the product does it
- Constraints are a requirement set by the client before the project. ie. budget, space

# 08/31/16 (440)

- Communication Diagrams -> aka collaboration diagrams
- Class diagrams are the most widely used and known
- Italics represent an abstract class
- Multiplicities: 1 is exactly one, * is many (zero or more), 0..1 is optional (zero or one), m..n is numerically specified.
