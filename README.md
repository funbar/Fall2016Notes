# Fall2016Notes


### IceScrum
##### Sprint Plan
- View/Create Tasks and move them around accordingly

##### Release Plan
- Displays all springs and statuses of where they currently are

##### Timeline
- Shows a more undefined/vague overview of the whole project. This includes the sprint numbers and the project.

##### Product Backlog
- Contains stories which have been accepted by the product owner.

##### Sandbox
- Stories go into the sandbox 

##### Dashboard
- Displays a graph visual, kind of like Github which allows others to monitor how the sprints are being handled. Also shows an overview of the project description, release vision, retrospective, activity log, etc.

### Topics for Midterm #1

- The Classic Waterfall Model
- The V model
- Activity Diagram 
### Iterative Approaches
- Boehm's Spiral Model
- Unified Process

### Agile Development
- Embrace change, rather than fear it
- Development in small chunks without planning the whole project out. Do it as you go.
- Incremental functionality delivered as the project proceeds
- Rapid development methods
- More suitable for small teams working on shorter-term projects

- Rugby method is moving forward in a series of sprints.

### Use Case Diagram
- AKA Scenario diagrams

- Scenarios are informal stories written in a narrative fashion. They help convey a general understanding
- Use Cases are more formal

### Sequence Diagrams 

- document the steps taken during a single use case

### Communication Diagrams

- AKA collaboration diagrams
- Same info as a sequence diagram

### Requirements
- Specific, detailed, unambiguous specifications of the features
- Often used as a contract between others
- Functional Requirements specify features the SW must perform
- Non-Function Requirements specify other properties the system must have
- WHAT versus HOW the product does it
- Constraints are a requirement set by the client before the project. ie. budget, space

# 08/31/16 (440)

- Communication Diagrams -> aka collaboration diagrams
- Class diagrams are the most widely used and known
- Italics represent an abstract class
- Multiplicities: 1 is exactly one, * is many (zero or more), 0..1 is optional (zero or one), m..n is numerically specified.

$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".

*	    $("*")	All elements
